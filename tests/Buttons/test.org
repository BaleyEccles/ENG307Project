* Buttons
This test will read the digital input from pins 2 and 3, and will display the state on the serial monitor. When a button is pushed the serial monitor should display a 0, and a 1 when it is not pressed.

This will allow us to verify that the connections to the Arduino and reading of the digital pins are correct.
